    <p>Traditional and comforting. What more could you ask for this autumn?</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>750g/1lb 10oz pumpkin</li>
        <li>plain flour (for dusting)</li>
        <li>140g/5oz caster sugar</li>
        <li>0.5 tsp salt</li>
        <li>0.5 tsp fresh nutmeg (grated)</li>
        <li>1 tsp cinnamon</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>25g/1oz butter</li>
        <li>175ml/6 fl oz milk</li>
        <li>1 tbsp icing sugar</li>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><h3>Boil Pumpkin</h3></li>
        <p>Place the pumpkin in a large saucepan, cover with water and bring to the boil. Cover with a lid and simmer for 15 mins or until tender. Drain pumpkin; let cool.</p>
        <li><h3>Pre-heat the oven and prepare pastry</h3></li>
        <p>Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface and use it to line a 22cm loose-bottomed tart tin. Chill for 15 mins. Line the pastry with baking parchment and baking beans, then bake for 15 mins. Remove the beans and paper, and cook for a further 10 mins until the base is pale golden and biscuity. Remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly.</p>
        <li><h3>Make the filling and bake</h3></li>
        <p>Increase oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Push the cooled pumpkin through a sieve into a large bowl or blend to a puree in a food processor. In a separate bowl, combine the sugar, salt, nutmeg and half the cinnamon. Mix in the beaten eggs, melted butter and milk, then add to the pumpkin pur√©e and stir to combine. Pour into the tart shell and cook for 10 mins, then reduce the temperature to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Continue to bake for 35-40 mins until the filling has just set.</p>
        <li><h3>Leave to cool</h3></li>
        <p>Leave to cool, then remove the pie from the tin. Mix the remaining cinnamon with the icing sugar and dust over the pie. Serve chilled.</p>
    </ol>
